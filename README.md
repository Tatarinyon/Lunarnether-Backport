Adds the Moon, without being a tech mod. The Nether's usual bedrock ceiling is replaced with a new layer of rock hiding an interesting landscape above. Nether Portals work as usual.

Current Features: 

+ 1 new Biome: Outrocks(pseudo biome so it works with any mod that adds biomes or NetherApi if world height is not altered)
+ Several new world gen features
+ New stone type, including polished and cut variants 
+ 1 new Ore: Ilmenite, can be smelted into Titanium which is purely decorational
+ 1 new material: Titanium, can make building blocks just like copper
